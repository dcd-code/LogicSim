Steps:

-After downloading, extract the zip file.

-In the extracted folder, you have to run the folder that is inside the extracted folder and not the whole extracted folder. If you open the whole in for example VS code, errors will occur and it won't run correctly.

If you have done the previous steps correctly, you will be taken to a listing directory that should look similar to this.

After clicking the "Click Heree" folder you will be taken to another listing directory that should look similar to this.

After clicking the "Click Here" folder you will be able to use the Logic Circuit Simulator which should look like this.

**You might have to resize the window to 75% instead of 100% to ensure it runs correctly.**

To connect components, you will have to click on the nodes of the component.
